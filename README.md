# hello-world
First repository
This is my first attempt at learning data science and creating a GitHub repository to share my work. I want to learn R in order to analyze college basketball data and write interesting articles about what i find.
I hope I can learn how to use R to power my analysis, and create interactive dashboards with the data for subscribers.
